# SEPM-Assignment
## Software Engineering Project Management 2020 Semester 1

The course is designed to allow students to learn how to take a client brief and follow a design principle.

In the case we used the Scrum frame work with a client provided to us, apart from designing and building the website, we needed to design all the user stories, timelines, story points and develop sprints to create a website that allowed users to input a location and input data that would be a control interface for a robot to pull data from

This website was made using Python, Flask & MySQL with a very basic front end from CSS.

This was a team based assignment
